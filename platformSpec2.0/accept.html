We gladly inform you that your recent Vendor Request has been approved. 
After reviewing your request, we have determined that Macy's will move forward with this vendor.
	<br>
	<br>
Using the information you presented us, a couple red flags were raised and were sufficiently mitigated,
leading to the acceptance of risk acceptance by your Pyramid Head.
If there were any misunderstanding with the data presented and how it was interpreted, please reach out to "_________" for clarity.
