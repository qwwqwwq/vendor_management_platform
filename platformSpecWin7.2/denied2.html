	<h1>Vendor Risk Request 
		<br>
	Status: Declined</h1>

<p class="sorry">
	Dear Requestor,
	<br>
	<br>
We regret to inform you that your recent Vendor Request has been denied. 
After reviewing your request, we have determined that Macy's cannot move forward with this vendor.
	<br>
	<br>
Using the information you presented us, a couple red flags were raised and left unmitigated,
leading to the refusal of risk acceptance by your Pyramid Head.
If there were any misunderstanding with the data presented and how it was interpreted, please reach out to "_________" for clarity.
	<br>
	<br>
We thank you for your time and effort,
	<br>
	<br>
Risk Platform
